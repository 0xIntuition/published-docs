Intuition mitigates these risks by employing an economic model similar to those in blockchain networks, necessitating a fee for data creation. This economic\ndisincentive discourages abuse, thereby preserving the system\u2019s integrity and functionality. Furthermore, any attacks inadvertently benefit the network due to the fee payment, much like how Ethereum benefits from transaction fees even when used for non-productive purposes. This mechanism ensures the ecosystem\nremains robust and sustainable despite potential misuse."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Secondly, the creation of coherent and valuable data is often neglected, especially within the Web3 environment. Providing infrastructure for generating verifiable data alone has proven insufficient in motivating users to produce meaningful contributions. This issue is also prevalent in Web2, where the majority of users refrain from leaving reviews on platforms such as Amazon, Yelp, or Google, and rarely endorse others on LinkedIn or contribute to Wikipedia. Thus, there is a clear need for incentives to promote active and meaningful participation in the data contribution process, similar to how block rewards encourage participation in the layer 1 blockchain consensus process."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Thirdly, the sheer volume of data generated globally has reached overwhelming proportions, leading to an abundance of low-quality, redundant, or irrelevant information. This overabundance dilutes the value of truly meaningful and actionable data, complicating efforts to derive valuable insights. In both Web2 and Web3 environments, the emphasis needs to shift from merely producing more data to generating high-quality, reliable information. Intuition addresses this challenge by implementing mechanisms that discourage the production of irrelevant data and promote the creation of useful, pertinent information through economic incentives. By introducing an economic cost and associated rewards to data creation and curation, Intuition ensures that contributors are motivated to generate data that is coherent, valuable, and meets predefined standards of relevance and accuracy.
